# vestabook

Runs a whole book on a physical [Vestaboard](https://www.vestaboard.com/), advancing to the
next chunk of text on a timer. Deployed on Vercel, no database, no admin UI, no scheduler of
its own — a third-party cron service (cron-job.org) is what drives it forward.

Live: https://vestabook.vercel.app

## Design: no database, no stored position

The current frame is computed purely from elapsed time:

```
frameIndex = floor((now - startTime) / (INTERVAL_MINUTES * 60_000)) % totalFrames
```

There's no row in a database saying "we're on frame 42." That means:

- Every instance (and every cold start) agrees on the current frame without coordination.
- Restarting the app, redeploying, or scaling to multiple instances doesn't lose your place.
- If quiet hours or a manual pause are active (see below), progression pauses during that
  window and resumes with the next section afterward — it does not skip ahead, because the
  "elapsed time" the frame index is based on excludes those minutes entirely (`lib/time.ts`).

Book *selection* (which book, or random, or forced) can't follow that same "purely
computed" rule, though — it's a choice made from outside, at an arbitrary moment, and has to
be remembered until it's changed again. See **Book library & `/api/control`** below for how
that's done without a database.

## How it works

1. **Pagination** (`lib/paginate.ts`, runs per book and is cached):
   - Each `content/<id>.txt` is read, smart quotes/dashes are normalized to ASCII, whitespace
     is collapsed, and the whole thing is uppercased (the physical board is uppercase-only).
   - Text is word-wrapped to 22 characters per line (Vestaboard's column count), never
     splitting a word.
   - Lines are grouped into frames of up to 6 lines (Vestaboard's row count), but the cut
     point prefers the last line in the window that ends in `.`, `,`, or `;` — so a 5-minute
     refresh lands on a clause boundary instead of mid-sentence. Only falls back to a hard
     6-line cut when no such punctuation appears anywhere in the window.
2. **`GET /api/tick`** — the only endpoint that writes to the board:
   - Requires header `X-Tick-Secret` matching the `TICK_SECRET` env var; returns `401` if
     missing/wrong.
   - Skips (no push, no board change) if currently paused or in quiet hours — see below.
   - Otherwise resolves the current `(book, frame)` via `lib/sequencer.ts` and encodes each
     line into Vestaboard's character-code table (`lib/vestaboardCodes.ts`).
   - POSTs `{"characters": [...]}` to the Vestaboard Cloud API. Returns `502` with the
     upstream error body if Vestaboard rejects the request (e.g. bad `VESTABOARD_TOKEN`).
3. **`GET /api/preview`** — no auth, returns the current frame as 6 lines of plain text, plus
   `X-Book-Id` / `X-Frame-Index` / `X-Quiet-Hours` / `X-Paused` headers. Use this to
   sanity-check pagination or debug timing without touching the real board.
4. **`GET /api/control`** — dongle-gated, changes which book/mode is showing. See below.

## Book library & `/api/control`

Every `content/*.txt` file is a book, identified by its filename minus `.txt` (e.g.
`content/moby_dick.txt` → id `moby_dick`). Currently shipped: `paradise_lost`, `moby_dick`,
`inferno`. Add a book by committing a new `.txt` file — no code changes needed.

With no book forced, the app auto-cycles through every book in the library in order, looping
back to the first once the last one finishes. `GET /api/control` changes that:

```
GET /api/control?book=moby_dick&dongle=<CONTROL_DONGLE_SECRET>   # force one book, loops it forever
GET /api/control?random=true&dongle=<CONTROL_DONGLE_SECRET>      # reroll to a new random book each time one finishes
GET /api/control?random=false&dongle=<CONTROL_DONGLE_SECRET>     # back to auto-cycle
GET /api/control?pause=true&dongle=<CONTROL_DONGLE_SECRET>       # freeze progression
GET /api/control?pause=false&dongle=<CONTROL_DONGLE_SECRET>      # resume exactly where it paused
```

Flags can be combined in one request (e.g. `?book=moby_dick&pause=true&dongle=...`); only the
flags you pass are changed, everything else is left as-is.

**Why this needs a git commit, not just a request:** `/api/tick` deliberately takes no query
params — cron-job.org always hits the same bare URL, forever. So a choice made by visiting
`/api/control` has to be remembered independently, for an arbitrary amount of time, until
changed again. With no database and no API to edit Vercel env vars, the only "no database"
option left is the one this project already uses for the book text itself: a file tracked in
git. `/api/control` reads `config/state.json` via the GitHub Contents API, merges in your
flags, and commits it straight to `main` — which Vercel's git integration then redeploys
automatically, the same as pushing a new book file by hand. That means **changes take
15-30 seconds to actually reach the board** (the length of a redeploy), not instantly, and
every flag change adds a commit to the repo's history. `random` mode itself needs no state
beyond "random is on" — which book is "currently" showing is computed the same way frame
index is: deterministically from elapsed time, so every server instance agrees without
comparing notes (see `lib/sequencer.ts`).

## Env vars (set in Vercel dashboard — changes require a redeploy to take effect)

| Var | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VESTABOARD_TOKEN` | yes | Vestaboard Cloud API token (Read/Write scope) |
| `TICK_SECRET` | yes | Shared secret; cron-job.org must send it as `X-Tick-Secret` |
| `INTERVAL_MINUTES` | no | Defaults to `5`. Must match the cron-job.org schedule |
| `START_TIME` | no | ISO timestamp; defaults to build time (`BUILD_TIME`, stamped into `next.config.mjs` at build) if unset |
| `QUIET_HOURS_START` | no | `HH:MM` (24h), local to `QUIET_HOURS_TZ`. Omit to disable quiet hours entirely |
| `QUIET_HOURS_END` | no | `HH:MM` (24h). Window can wrap midnight (e.g. `22:00`–`07:00`) |
| `QUIET_HOURS_TZ` | no | IANA timezone (e.g. `America/New_York`). Defaults to `UTC` |
| `CONTROL_DONGLE_SECRET` | yes (for `/api/control`) | Shared secret; must be passed as `?dongle=...` |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | yes (for `/api/control`) | Fine-grained PAT, Contents read/write scoped to this repo only |
| `GITHUB_REPO` | yes (for `/api/control`) | `MrManeki-neko/vestabook` |

## cron-job.org setup

Create a job:
- **URL**: `https://<your-deployment>/api/tick` — use the real production domain, not a
  deleted/renamed project's old `*.vercel.app` alias (see Troubleshooting).
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Schedule**: every `INTERVAL_MINUTES` minutes
- **Headers**: `X-Tick-Secret: <TICK_SECRET>`

## Quiet hours / do-not-disturb

Set `QUIET_HOURS_START` / `QUIET_HOURS_END` / `QUIET_HOURS_TZ` to match whatever do-not-disturb
schedule you've configured in the Vestaboard app (there's no API to read that schedule back,
so it has to be entered here too). `lib/quietHours.ts` defines the window as a fixed daily
`HH:MM`–`HH:MM` range in that timezone.

With it configured:
- `GET /api/tick` checks the window first and, if it's currently quiet, returns
  `{"ok": true, "skipped": "quiet_hours"}` without calling the Vestaboard API at all.
- The shared clock (`getGlobalTick` in `lib/time.ts`) counts only "awake" minutes since
  `START_TIME` — quiet-hour minutes, on every day in the range, don't count toward advancing
  to the next frame. That's what makes it pause and resume with the next section rather than
  jumping ahead.
- `GET /api/preview` exposes the current state via an `X-Quiet-Hours: true/false` response
  header, for checking the window logic without waiting for a real quiet period.

Leave both unset (the default) to disable this — the app behaves as before, always awake.
Note: the awake/quiet calculation uses a single UTC-offset snapshot per request rather than
per-day DST-aware offsets, so there can be a few minutes of drift right around a DST
transition. Not worth the complexity for a hobby project.

## Manual pause (`/api/control?pause=true`)

Works the same way as quiet hours, but triggered by you instead of a fixed daily schedule:
`config/state.json` records a `pausedAt` timestamp when you pause, and accumulates the total
paused duration into `accumulatedPauseMinutes` when you unpause. `lib/time.ts` subtracts both
from elapsed time, so — like quiet hours — the board freezes on `pause=true` and resumes with
the exact next section on `pause=false`, rather than jumping ahead by however long it was
paused. `GET /api/tick` returns `{"ok": true, "skipped": "paused"}` while paused.

## Troubleshooting

- **`401` from `/api/tick`**: `X-Tick-Secret` header doesn't match `TICK_SECRET`. Check for
  trailing whitespace from copy-paste, and confirm you redeployed after setting/changing the
  env var (Vercel only applies env var changes on the next deploy).
- **`502` from `/api/tick`**: Vestaboard rejected the POST — usually a bad or expired
  `VESTABOARD_TOKEN`. The response body includes Vestaboard's error text.
- **`200` from `/api/tick` but the board doesn't update**: if the body is
  `{"skipped": "quiet_hours"}`, that's expected — it's currently inside the configured quiet
  window. Otherwise, double check the cron job's URL actually points at the current
  production domain — a renamed or deleted Vercel project can leave a stale `*.vercel.app`
  alias that still resolves and returns `200` without reaching this app at all.
- **Vercel build fails with `No Output Directory named "public" found"`**: the project's
  Framework Preset isn't set to Next.js. Settings → General → Build & Development Settings →
  Framework Preset → Next.js, then redeploy.
- **`401` from `/api/control`**: `?dongle=` doesn't match `CONTROL_DONGLE_SECRET`.
- **`502` with `github_read_failed` or `github_write_failed` from `/api/control`**:
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` is missing/expired/wrong scope, or `GITHUB_REPO` doesn't match
  `owner/repo`. The token needs Contents read/write on this repo.
- **`502` with `github_write_failed` and a `409` status specifically**: the GitHub Contents
  API rejected the write because `config/state.json`'s sha moved between the read and the
  write (another control call landed first, or a cached read served a stale sha). The route
  already retries this automatically up to 3 times with a fresh `no-store` read each time
  (`app/api/control/route.ts`) — if you still see a 409 after that, something is writing to
  `config/state.json` very frequently, or GitHub's API is having a bad moment; just retry.
- **`/api/control` returns `ok: true` but the board doesn't reflect it yet**: expected for
  the first 15-30 seconds — it just committed to `main` and Vercel is redeploying. Check
  `/api/preview`'s `X-Book-Id` header once the new deployment is ready.
